##Lumx on Rails showcase

This is a simple showcase to show off some of the cool stuff from Lumx framework through Rails asset pipeline.

The app demonstrated Lumx's features like:

- Dropdowns
- Text fields
- Search filter
- Selects
- File inputs
- Tooltips
- Thumbnails
- Data tables
etc.

All the assets are served by Rails asset pipeline.

##Todo list
Some stuff is just implemented to showcase Lumx's functionality and so they are not optimized for performance and they are not done with "best practice" in mind.
Though, need to dedicate some time for polishing:
- Show car feature
- Add car feature
- Search query animation
